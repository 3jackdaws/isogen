	At the start of last spring break, I became enthralled with Hacker.org's Runaway Robot puzzle game. For anyone not familiar, Runaway Robot is a puzzle game where the player controls a little robot character with a queue of commands. The queue must be built of only so many or so few "right" and "down" commands and attempts to move the robot off of the playarea. The robot must also avoid obstacles that resemble bombs on its journey to the edge of the board. The game can be played by hand, if one so desires, but that is not the point of runaway robot, or any puzzle game on hacker.org.

	After about Level 100, or so, the site refuses to display the board at all.  At this point playing by hand is extremely tedious, and if a player hasn't created a bot to do the guesswork, he or she should start.`
