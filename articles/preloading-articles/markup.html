<h1>How to Instantly Load a Web Page</h1>
<h2>Preloading web pages solves a problem that didnt exist and introduces several new, very real problems.</h2>

    When I set out to design this site, I originally just wanted it to be a clean, minimalist place to serve up posts I had written.  However, my constant desire to make things better made me reconsider the mechanism which posts and article are served.  Visitors will only read one page at a time, so what's the point of having multiple locations on the website?  What if I just retrieved the page when the user requests it and swapped it out with the previous page?  Even better, what if the page the user wanted was already loaded in the background and by clicking on the link for that page, it could be instantly displayed?
</p>
<p>
	That train of thought got me to the idea of preloading, all that was left was the implementation details.  Probably the easiest way to load one page into another would be through the use of iframes, but I have done web dev before so the thought of ever using iframes did not cross my mind at the time.  I instantly thought of jQuery's hover and click event handlers.  Just add a hover and click event handler to every element with .preload class and we're off to the races.  Unfortunately, it's not just that easy.

<p>
	I can preload a page well enough on a mouseover event and swap out the loaded page on a click event, but the address bar url never changes.  It is now impossible to bookmark pages and it becomes apparent that the web page is never actually changing.  Luckily, HTML5 introduces several window history manipulation methods, namely widow.pushState and window.replaceState.  These methods can be used to make it seem like the browser location has changed, while in reality, it has not changed at all.  This fixed the bookmarking problem, sort of.  A page can be bookmarked, but when the bookmark is actually visited, the page is improperly loaded.  The contents of the page only look correct when inserted into the containing divs of the home page.  
</p>

	The page loading problem is fixed with a little PHP.
</p>
<pre><code>
	header('Location: http://' . 
					$_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"] . 
					"/?article=" . 
					basename(__DIR__));
</code></pre>
<p>
	This index.php file, which is loaded by apache whenever the directory is accessed, simply redirects the browser to the server root with some GET variables to tell the page what article to load.  The home page loads the article with the correct formatting and changes the url to reflect the bookmark. Ayy, preloading.  All of this was done using jQuery, but I'm currently writing a small library in vanilla JavaScript to do the same thing.
