	Previously, when I needed to update the live website on my actual webserver, I would spool up Filezilla and start double clicking on the files that I remembered I had changed.  There must be a better way to do this.  Aha! I thought.  This website's source code is kept on <a href="https://github.com/3jackdaws/isogen" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I could just install git on the server and git pull whenever I needed to update.  However, that involves sshing into the webserver, navigating to the site directory and <code>git pull</code>ing from there.  That method is no better than FTPing all the files over.  
</p>
<p>	
	Then I remembered GitHub's Webhooks feature.  What if I told GitHub to send a message to a specific page on my webserver whenever I pushed to the website repository?  Well, turns out it can't be a specific message, and it can't even be for an overly specific reason.  GitHub will only send its massive payload of data when one of several conditions are met and I don't want the sever to automatically pull changes every time.  One of those conditions was on every push and I figured I could work with that.  I set up GitHub to send me a truckload of mostly unneccesary data whenever I pushed to the repo and after several tens of pushes, I managed to correctly parse this data.  Using some fancy regular expressions, I told my webserver to scan the commit messages for a string that matches the pattern: 
</p>
<p><center><code>/(?&lt;=KRONOS:)[ ]*'.+'/</code></center>
</p>
<p>
	For the string <code>"Just added some cool new features. KRONOS: 'update'"</code>, the matched strings will just be: 'update'.  This can then be parsed for individual commands.  So far, only "update" does anything, but I plan to add more commands when I can figure out exactly what I need.  Anyways, the benefits of this system should be obvious: I never need to directly interact with my webserver again, at least until this inexplicitly breaks.
