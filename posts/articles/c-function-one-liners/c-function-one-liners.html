<h1>C One-Liners</h1>
<h2>Writing C code in the least amount of lines possible.</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    The other day a friend wondered out loud how one would write a simple function in C to count the number of occurrences of a character in a string.  "I can do it," I said, and after a brief pause finished, "in two lines."
</p>
<p>
    "Then do it," he retorted.  My bluff was called, I actually didn't know if I could.  I don't remember ever writing a function to count characters in a string and I absolutely don't remember doing it in two lines.  Before I started, I needed to figure out the fried's definition of "lines".  To him, a line is a statement ending in a semicolon ( <code>for(i=0;i&lt;n;i++)</code> would count as one line). Moreover, the friend needed the character counting function for a class and the class didn't allow compiling with the std=c99 flag meaning variables cannot be defined in the same statement they are declared in.  Well, this might be harder than I thought; the above for loop example still needs a variable declaration.
</p>
<p>
    My first attempt started out with a for loop as the base.
</p>
<pre><code>
    int count_chars(char * str, char c)
    {
        int count;
        for (i=0;*str!=0;*str++==c?i++:0);
        return count;
    }
</code></pre>
<p>
    Pretty good.  This is probably as efficient it will get, but I said two lines and the code I wrote is three.  I can do better.  Variables are inherently space inefficient because basically any line they are declared on is wasted.  Return statements are also wasted space; they must exist and I had trouble trying to place a return statement within a ternary operator. What if I could avoid both variable declaration and wasting lines on return statements? My next iteration of the count characters function implemented both of these ideas.
</p>
<pre><code>
    int countc(char * str, char c)
    {
        return *str==0?0:countc(str+1, c) + (*str==c?1:0);
    }
</code></pre>

    This implementation uses recursion to absolutely obliterate your call stack.  It uses several orders of magnitude more memory and runs about four times slower.  The built in memory profiler in XCode doesn't have a high enough resolution to determine the amount of memory the iterative three-line count character function uses while the recursive approach uses 380kb of memory to scan through a 12,000 character string.  The recursive aproach may be more space effiecient and is impressively cryptic, but boy is it not the right way to do things.
