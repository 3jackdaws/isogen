    Currently, only two virtual reality platforms exist on Windows PCs: the Oculus Rift and the SteamVR-powered HTC Vive. Each set has its strengths and weaknesses, but until recently, they at least both offered limited compatibility with their rival's software stores. Oculus headset users can pick through compatible games on the SteamVR store and interface, while HTC Vive wearers could install a fan-made patch to play Oculus software.

    SteamVR still plays nice, but the other side changed its tune on Friday with a major Oculus app update for Windows PCs, complete with advertised "updates to platform integrity checks." It didn't take long for the team behind that aforementioned HTC Vive patch, dubbed "Revive," to announce that those "integrity checks" appeared to block users' access to Oculus games on unauthorized hardware.

    "Oculus has added a check [to look for] whether the Oculus Rift headset is connected to their Oculus Platform DRM," Revive developer "CrossVR" posted to the Vive Reddit community on Friday. "While Revive fools the application [into] thinking the Rift is connected, it does nothing to make the actual Oculus platform think the headset is connected."

    When asked about the update, Oculus spokesperson Jim Redner told Ars that the app's new entitlement check was added "to curb piracy and protect games and apps that developers have worked so hard to make. This update wasn’t targeted at a specific hack." He also claimed that the entitlement check's functionality is "common in commerce platforms that validates a user has purchased a piece of software." However, the Revive team's representative alleged that the issue isn't a check for legitimate software purchases but for whether Oculus hardware is connected—and even suggests a workaround of attaching an Oculus development kit model so that a Revive-patched game can then operate normally on an HTC Vive headset. We have asked Oculus to clarify these contradicting claims and will update this report with any response.
